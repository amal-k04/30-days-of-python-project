# Day 1: Variables and Data Types #1

## *Task*: Declare and print variables.

### *Description*:
In Python, variables are used to store data values. Python has various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and more. You can declare a variable and store a value in it, and then use the `print()` function to display that value and type.

### *Example*:
```python
# Declaring variables
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5

# Printing variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
 
Output:

Name: Alice
Age: 30
Height: 5.5
